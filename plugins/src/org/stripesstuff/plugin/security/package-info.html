<p>
	Package to provide the security for the Stripes framework.
</p>

<p>
	Like Stripes, it uses annotations instead of the traditional xml configuration. This security solution secures
	events on action beans, as defined by the action beans themselves and decided upon by a security manager.
	This is particularly useful for those wanting an ACL based system or tying into legacy systems using ACL based
	security: the classes/methods declare the security, which can even depend on runtime information (for example
	whether or not the user owns the object the event is about).
</p>

<p>
	The security solution from this package includes a security interceptor, which enforces the decisions from the
	security manager. An example implementation of the security manager is supplied, called {@link J2EESecurityManager},
	that implements annotations from the {@code javax.annotation.security} package in the J2EE 5 API.
</p>

<p>
	In addition to the interceptor, a security solution would not be complete without a way to show or hide screen
	elements based on the decisions of the security manager. To help with this, a JSP tag is provided that takes an
	action bean instance and an event name to determine if that event may be executed on that action bean.
</p>

<p>
	Note however, that this security solution only affects security decisions that can be taken before an event handler
	your action bean executes. Therefore, it does not filter collections returned by action beans. Nor does it provide a
	JSP tag to check whether or not access to a URL is allowed, because URL's also commonly refer to other resources
	than action beans.
</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>

<p>
	To configure the Stripes framework to use this security solution, add the interceptor
	({@link nl.opk.stripes.security.SecurityInterceptor}) to the interceptors used, and add the security manager class
	to the configuration parameters. An example is displayed below, from configuration that silently uses the
	{@link net.sourceforge.stripes.controller.BeforeAfterMethodInterceptor BeforeAfterMethodInterceptor} (as
	documented).
</p>
<pre>        &lt;filter-class&gt;net.sourceforge.stripes.controller.StripesFilter&lt;/filter-class&gt;
        &lt;init-param&gt;
            &lt;param-name&gt;Extension.Packages&lt;/param-name&gt;
            &lt;param-value&gt;org.stripesstuff.plugin.security&lt;/param-value&gt;
        &lt;/init-param&gt;
        &lt;init-param&gt;
            &lt;param-name&gt;SecurityManager.Class&lt;/param-name&gt;
            &lt;param-value&gt;org.stripesstuff.plugin.security.J2EESecurityManager&lt;/param-value&gt;
        &lt;/init-param&gt;</pre>

<h1>Using the JSP tag</h1>

<p>
	Start by defining the tag in your JSP file:
</p>
<pre>    &lt;%@ taglib uri="http://www.stripes-stuff.org/security.tld" prefix="security"%&gt;</pre>
<p>
	This allows you to use the security tag in your JSP.
