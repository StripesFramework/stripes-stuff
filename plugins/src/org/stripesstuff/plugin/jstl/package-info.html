	JSTL Bundle PLugin &mdash; Package to provide easy localization for a web application.
</p>

<p>
	Stripes has some localization, but only for error messages and field names. If you want more, you can use the
	ubiquitous JSTL formatting tags. You can even configure it in your <code>web.xml</code>:
</p>
<pre>    &lt;config-param&gt;
        &lt;param-name&gt;javax.servlet.jsp.jstl.fmt.LocalizationContext&lt;/param-name&gt;
        &lt;param-value&gt;StripesResources&lt;/param-value&gt;
    &lt;/config-param&gt;</pre>
<p>
	Note however, that this approach only works for simple ResourceBundles, i.e. with <code>.properties</code> files.
	The JSTL bundle plugin provides a means to go beyond this. Whenever you use the JSTL tags for localization and you
	also implement your own {@link net.sourceforge.stripes.localization.LocalizationBundleFactory}, you'll benefit from
	using it.
</p>
<h1>Using this plugin</h1>
<p>
	The plugin has two modes of operation: reuse the JSTL default, or set the JSTL default.
</p>
<p>
	To reuse the JSTL default, configure Stripes to use org.stripesstuff.plugin.jstl.JstlLocalizationBundleFactory
	as LocalizationBundleFactory. This ensures that Stripes uses your context parameter to load the ResourceBundle for
	error messages, field names and the default bundle in JSP's.
</p>
<p>
	You can also set the JSTL default using the plugin. To do that, configure Stripes to use the
	{@link JstlBundleInterceptor}, either by explicit configuration, or by including this package as an extension
	package. Configuration notes can be found in the javadoc of {@link JstlBundleInterceptor}.
</p>
<p>
	If you configure both approaches, the LocalizationBundleFactory approach takes precedence (the interceptor disable—ï
	itself).
